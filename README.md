# rcll_simulation_webots
This Git repository encompasses a comprehensive collection of code files designed to establish a simulated environment in Webots, replicating the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL) game field and incorporating Robotino robots from Festo GmbH. Additionally, the repository introduces a representative industrial production scenario. It provides essential packages for constructing detailed robot and machine descriptions, implementing sensor interfaces, developing omnidirectional robot controllers, integrating a SLAM toolbox for mapping, and deploying the Navigation2 (Nav2) stack for autonomous navigation.

Encouraging collaboration and contributions, the repository aims to serve as a reliable resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts in the fields of robotics and simulation. Regular updates ensure compatibility with evolving dependencies, making it a sustainable and valuable tool for the robotics community.

## Installation
### Installation Premise
This repository has been tested on [ROS2 Humble] and with Webots 2023b. It is recommended to use the same versions to avoid any issues;

These instructions assume that you have already installed ROS2 Humble on your machine. If not, please follow the recommended recommended ubuntu installation tutorial;

Create a ROS2 workspace, Once you have created the workspace, clone this repository in the source folder of your workspace.


### Workspace Setup:
ATTENTION: These commands assume that you have created a workspace called "ros2/robotino_sim_ws" in your home directory. If you used a different directory or name, please adjust the commands accordingly.

After installing ROS2 and creating the workspace, clone this repository in your workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2/robotino_sim_ws/src
cd ~/ros2/robotino_sim_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/carologistics/rcll_simulation_webots.git
vcs import --recursive . < rcll_simulation_webots/dependencies.repos
touch src/ros2-robotino/rto_node/AMENT_IGNORE
```
Install the binary dependencies by running the following command in the root of your workspace:

```bash
cd ~/ros2/robotino_sim_ws
rosdep init
rosdep update

sudo apt update

rosdep install --from-paths src/rcll_simulation_webots --ignore-src -r -y --rosdistro humble
```


If all dependencies are already installed, you should see the message "All required rosdeps installed successfully."

### Building:
To build the workspace, run the following commands:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
cd ~/ros2/robotino_sim_ws/
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```
## Basic Usage
First, the steps to run the simulation with a single robot is outlined.
### Spawning simulation with one instance of robot

```bash
ros2 launch robotino_simulation robotino_simulation.launch.py namespace:=robotinobase1 launch_rviz:=true use_sim_time:=true
```

- namespace: It's a launch configuration used to spawn the corresponding robotinobase(1/2/3), its controllers, and node parameters
- launch_rviz: It's a launch configuration for starting the Rviz2 with the predefined config file, parse 'false' when using nav2_stack
- use_sim_time: Whether to use system time or not, this parameter needs to be consistent across the differently launched components


### Launch SLAM toolbox

For mapping the environment, first launch the single instance of robotinobase in simulation, ensure the joystick device is connected with correct device ID (by default, device_id=0).

To check the currently recognized joysticks run:

```bash
    ros2 run joy joy_enumerate_devices
```

If you have trouble connecting a joystick, we recommend to use [evtest](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/evtest.1.html) to check on which event the joystick is registered, it should show the joystick without requiring root privileges, if this is not the case, correct permissions.

```bash
evtest
No device specified, trying to scan all of /dev/input/event*
Not running as root, no devices may be available.
Available devices:
/dev/input/event15:	Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver
```

then launch the SLAM toolbox by running the following command after sourcing the workspace:

```bash
ros2 launch robotino_slamtoolbox robotino_slam.launch.py namespace:=robotinobase1 use_sim_type:=true
```

Map the environment using the joystick, once the map is ready, save the map by running the following command in the root of your workspace:

```bash
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f <path-where-to-store-file>
```

### Navigating on a known Map:

For autonomous navigation, first launch the single instance of robotinobase in simulation as described above, then launch the NAV2 stack by running the following command in the root of your workspace:

```bash
ros2 launch robotino_navigation robotino_bringup.launch.py namespace:=robotinobase1 use_sim_time:=true launch_nav2rviz:=true map:=map_webots.yaml
```

- namespace: It's a launch configuration used to spawn the map server, amcl, nav2_stack, collision monitor, and rviz2 with predefined configs for corresponding robotinobase(1/2/3)
- use_sim_time: to use sim time instead of system time
- launch_nav2rviz: whether to launch an rviz to visualize the navigation, including tools for localization and to send poses.
- map: yaml file for the map, if a relative path is given the map directory of the robotino_navigation package is also searched

Once the robot is localized, use the 2D Nav Goal tool in Rviz2 to send a goal to the robot.
## Advanced Usage with multiple Robots
This project also has pre-configured support to run 3 robotinos at once using the steps listed below.

### Spawn simulation with multiple instances

```bash
ros2 launch robotino_simulation robotinocluster_simulation.launch.py launch_rviz:=true
```

- launch_rviz: Its a launch configuration for starting the Rviz2 with the predefined config file, parse 'false' when using nav2_stack

- Connect a joystick to your machine and operate the robot using the joystick., by default device_id associated with the joystick is 0 (no need to change for a single instance of robotinobase spawn in simulation), in case of multiple instances of robotinobase spawn in simulation, change the device_id to 0 or 1 or 2 accordingly.
- by default:
    - robotinobase1: device_id = 1
    - robotinobase2: device_id = 2
    - robotinobase3: device_id = 0

### Navigation with known Map
For autonomous navigation, first launch the multiple instances of robotinobase in simulation as described above, then launch the different navigation stacks for each robot as done in th single-robot case.
